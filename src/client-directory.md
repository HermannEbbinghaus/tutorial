# Creating a client directory
What we have been working on up until now is the client for our application.
With Rust installed, we quickly will move into writing server code. We better
setup our project source tree to reflect our intentions.

This entails little more than to creating a `client` directory and moving our
stuff over there.

## Verification
Make sure that running the Elm reactor, or building the frontend still works as
expected.
