# What is this tutorial about?
In this tutorial you are going to learn how to create a flashcard app. A
flashcard is a

> card bearing information on both sides, which is intended to be used as an aid
> in memorization. Each flashcard bears a question on one side and an answer on
> the other. Flashcards are often used to memorize vocabulary, historical dates,
> formulae or any subject matter that can be learned via a question-and-answer
> format.

## Stack
The stack we are going to use in this tutorial is

* **frontend**: [Elm][elm-lang]
* **backend**: [Rust][rust-lang]

The reason for this eclectic mix is because it was the preference of
[@keinegurke_][]. They wanted to learn both Elm, Rust and German. But an in depth
tutorial was missing. Since flashcards could help them improve their vocabulary,
they soon settle on building an app and documenting their progress in this
tutorial.

## Prerequisites
What would you need to start with this tutorial? First of all; in interest in
either Elm, Rust, or both. The focus of this tutorial is in learning these
technologies.
Second is a computer and some experience with running commands in the
command line. Modern development relies increasingly on tools that require some
proficiency with the command line.

If you qualify, dive right in!
